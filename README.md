
# 🚚 IoT Data Simulation: Logistics Tracking System

## 🌐 Project Overview
Welcome to the **IoT-powered Logistics Data Simulator** — a fully customizable system that creates **realistic, high-fidelity logistics tracking data**. Whether you're building data-driven dashboards, testing ML models, or just exploring logistics analytics, this simulator is your sandbox for end-to-end package movement simulation.

## ✨ Features at a Glance
- 📦 **Realistic Package Profiles** – Varying dimensions, weights, and types (Standard, Express, Fragile, etc.)
- 📍 **Detailed Tracking History** – Timestamped location updates and facility checkpoints
- 🚛 **Multi-Carrier Simulation** – FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS, and more
- 🔐 **Advanced Attributes** – Insurance values and special handling requirements
- 📊 **Rich Analytical Output** – Explore patterns in movement, delays, and geographies
- 📘 **Plug-and-Play Analysis** – Comes with a Jupyter Notebook for instant data insights

## 🧠 Built With
- **Python 3.8+** – Core simulation logic
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Faker** – Realistic synthetic data
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Static visualizations
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualizations
